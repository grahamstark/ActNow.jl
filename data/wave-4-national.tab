Also, since the governing elite has the most say, theyâ€™d never agree for the tax policy aimed at their own fortunes. My household income appears healthy in a first glance but itâ€™s based on one personâ€™s salary and this can change at any time. So Iâ€™m not feeling financially stable or secure plus our mortgage and living expenses eat away everything each month, leaving us with no savings. I support the program wholeheartedly but i donâ€™t think itâ€™s a realistic one, sadly.	33	I always vote at General Elections	Labour Party		Labour Party		4. Agree	5. Strongly agree	2. Disagree	3.

Then the Tories would move further to the right, cement their wealth advantage and our country would enter a death spiral similar to the USA and Hungary and Israel.

Nationalisation - not at all, at least not until the regulator actually enforces the rules and therefore re-extracts the wealth from the current owners - rather than paying them to nationalise.  The tax proposals, just not enough information, too much tied together.  Housebuilding had sensible policies, but added rent control ludicrousness.  Education had sensible, but then continued to subsidise the already priviliged at university etc.   It's not about a change to my circumstances, just better proposals that would lead me to support them.  Other than UBI of course, which didn't have any of the negatives there, but did miss any detail on the amounts.	50	I always vote at General Elections	Labour Party		Labour Party		4. Agree	2.

There were some elements from all of the policies that i supported.. Some of the arguments sounded as though they were based on communist ideologies which sound good in theory but not in practice. We all know that it isnt right for children to go hungry and people to be forced to live in poverty but i couldnt help feeling that some of the policies were base around the idea that rich people should be punished. I certainly think that they should be paying their fair amount of taxes and that private education and health care should be abolished. 	30	I sometimes vote at General Elections	I chose not to vote at the last General Election		Other (please name below)	Undecided.

I may not be wealthy but if I save and work hard to educate my children privately, what is wrong with that.  All the rubbish about Private Health facilities in the NHS is jolly good.  The NHS have a block policy with BUPA and all NHS patients who receive treatments at private hospitals relieve the queues at the NHS hospitals.  The proposed health and education policies make no sense at all.  By making private education pay VAT is not going to raise what they think.  Because once registered for VAT, the payment to HMRC is definitely NOT 20% of gross income, it is the difference input tax and output tax (for example when VAT was 17Â½% the amount paid was 7/47ths)  Labour have got their sums wrong again. Why keep banging on about taxing the wealthy, and wealthy companies.  If you tax the wealthy they'll move abroad and if you tax companies they cannot expand and grow and create employment.  Also investors will diminish because of lower dividends.	81	I always vote at General Elections	Conservative Party		Conservative Party		3. Neither agree nor disagree	3. Neither agree nor disagree	3.

I get 0 benefits of any kind. I cannot afford a child yet the wealthiest 1% are not being taxed enough - they have creative accounting. Welfare state is out of control with people earning more than me. And us â€˜middle earnersâ€™ subsidise and get squeezed for everything! There is no incentive for someone to go to uni and get a 30k+ job and have to pay 3/4 of your salary just to SURVIVE. No quality of life at all. And basic income is just rewarding those who already get welfare state and punishing those who want more. Donâ€™t cap ambition and motivation. Reward it! But at least I have my health, for now! 	50	I always vote at General Elections	Prefer not to say		Prefer not to say		3. Neither agree nor disagree	3. Neither agree nor disagree	3.

It grieves me that benefits are given to people to easily.  I semi-retired at 49 after working 30 years, full time in a successful career.  However, my pension value has since halved (although I can't take it yet) and so I'm forced to look for ways to boost my pension again (even though 2 years ago, it was very healthy).  I'm frustrated, that other, who don't work, get everything for nothing...it's so wrong.  I honestly believe that everybody has a part to play - even if it's only a tiny part.  Why can't we introduce a system where benefits are earned?  For example, how many charities are calling out for volunteers (again, something I have done because i wanted to make a contribution to society)  Why can't people who claim benefits be required to prove they have given something back to society to earn those benefits ???  I would love to see people on benefits walking dogs at the local rescue, feeding animals, answering reception in a hostel, helping to decorate places...there is a part for everybody to play and I am sick and tired of people being rewarded for choosing to not play their part.	91	I always vote at General Elections	Conservative Party		Conservative Party		2.

Since losing my home ive had no stability in housing and have been in shared housing - moving every few years and never by choice. I feel very insecure financially due to how unexpected life situations can very quickly make people homeless.

I would need further info about how this is being funded given the current state of UK HE and the lack of progress made with union action. If there was a sensible plan for that which wouldnt result in smaller unis going bankrupt and staff being made redundant I would be absolutely on board.  	24	I always vote at General Elections	Labour Party		Don't know		4.
