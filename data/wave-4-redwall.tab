I get 0 benefits of any kind. I cannot afford a child yet the wealthiest 1% are not being taxed enough - they have creative accounting. Welfare state is out of control with people earning more than me. And us ‘middle earners’ subsidise and get squeezed for everything! There is no incentive for someone to go to uni and get a 30k+ job and have to pay 3/4 of your salary just to SURVIVE. No quality of life at all. And basic income is just rewarding those who already get welfare state and punishing those who want more. Don’t cap ambition and motivation. Reward it! But at least I have my health, for now!

It grieves me that benefits are given to people to easily.  I semi-retired at 49 after working 30 years, full time in a successful career.  However, my pension value has since halved (although I can't take it yet) and so I'm forced to look for ways to boost my pension again (even though 2 years ago, it was very healthy).  I'm frustrated, that other, who don't work, get everything for nothing...it's so wrong.  I honestly believe that everybody has a part to play - even if it's only a tiny part.  Why can't we introduce a system where benefits are earned?  For example, how many charities are calling out for volunteers (again, something I have done because i wanted to make a contribution to society)  Why can't people who claim benefits be required to prove they have given something back to society to earn those benefits ???  I would love to see people on benefits walking dogs at the local rescue, feeding animals, answering reception in a hostel, helping to decorate places...there is a part for everybody to play and I am sick and tired of people being rewarded for choosing to not play their part.",91,I always vote at General Elections,Conservative Party,,Conservative Party,,2.
