Things that we've put of replacing or doing like fencing the yard or replacing the freezer would be easier to attain. We wouldn't have to worry about whether we were going to be able to pay the bills without going to the bare bones of things. I reckon we'd eat a lot healthier too because we wouldn't be struggling to afford some of the more basic stuff and add more variety to fruits and veg instead of it just being, carrots, turnip, potatoes and apples. We wouldn't have to be supremely stingy with the heating pver winter so we don't end up paying too much. Generally speaking, i reckon the quality of life would change for the better, those of us that have mental health issues would be able to focus on sorting them out instead of having to constantly stress about fucking something up with the DWP and getting our benefits cut.

Things that we've put of replacing or doing like fencing the yard or replacing the freezer would be easier to attain. We wouldn't have to worry about whether we were going to be able to pay the bills without going to the bare bones of things.

It would also mean that I could spend more time assisting my elderly parents.  Both my parents have poor health and need my support with simple daily tasks such as shopping, managing finances, paying bills etc, the additional money would enable us to buy specialised items that could make things easier for them to cope on their own, such as a walk in shower as they both struggle to get in and out of the bath without assistance. I also have a friend who is currently unable to take time off work even though she is struggling due to having lost her Mother recently and her Husband is terminally ill.  Having the extra money would allow her the time off from work to care for him and look after herself, something she cannot currently do as she is only entitled to statutory sick pay.	4	1	8	1	4	2	4	2	3	4	38	1		51	1	2		2		85	35.90699481865285	9	4	3.0	2.0	Conservative	Conservative	false	true	false	false	13	3.5809321182602503

It would result in less pressure on us knowing that some form of funding would be available if the worst of the worst happens in our lives. I think it would be another way of helping us cope with the many challenges we face if hit my illness or are simply not able to earn money at a specific point in our lives and we need help to keep on living. Such a scheme would also help us live happier lives and cause less financial stress which can add to our troubles as a family. I think my friends and the rest of my family would also feel this way if such a scheme existed. 	3	3	5	2	4	1	3	4	1	4	33	2		50	3	8		8		75	17.033678756476682	11	16	3.3166247903554	4.0	No Vote/DK/Refused	Other	false	true	false	false	5	2.8351924875811343

I had been out of the workforce for 24 years when i was widowed because we had moved around the world with my husband's previous job. I suddenly found I had to find two new incomes. I managed to buy some properties which I let out on long term tenancies and some as holiday lets. I have also set up two online businesses which are still in their infancy. UBI would give me a financial buffer to allow me not to panic as much when my holiday lets close (covid) or my tenants stop paying rent (covid again). When the properties are full and producing income, I could use the UBI to invest further in my online businesses. Losing my husband has left me with severe mental health problems. I find that I can't organise anymore, my memory is shot to pieces, my verbal communication has been compromised. I found I was incapable of looking after my properties and therefore i have them professionally managed for me. I would hope that the knowledge that I had a guaranteed income coming in each week would lessen my mental burden and allow me to become more active in management of my own properties.

Food prices are rising, gas and electric prices are rising and even though wages are rising, it's not enough to cover the inflation. So hopefully UBI will also help top up wages. 	3	2	5	4	2	3	5	7	2	3	2	5	3	5	30	55	80	Having that extra money each month on top of my husband's wages, would really help us out with the constant rise of gas and electric, the rise of our monthly food shopping, covering uniform for my 4 school aged children, help cover the costs of my children's pack lunches. It would also help in saving to take my children on holiday which is something we have to save up for and end up with little spending money due to unexpected bills. It would also help other families that are worse off than me. They would he able to provide hot meals for their children, new clothes when they need them. Help get them out of debt. It would help them afford the basics they need in life without having to rely on food banks, free clothing and charity. 	3	1	7	1	4	2	3	2	2	4	33	1		40	2	8		10		75	32.931778929188255	2	2	1.4142135623730951	1.4142135623730951	No Vote/DK/Refused	Other	false	true	false	false	10	3.4944381164653984
